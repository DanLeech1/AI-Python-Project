# AI-Python-Project

This project demonstrates my experience with AI and machine learning through predicting real-world Japanese medical expenditure. Using Python and Scikit-learn (sklearn), I built a multivariate linear regression model to forecast future medical expenditure based on various contributing factors provided in an open source CSV dataset. The model is evaluated by its coefficient of determination, showcasing its accuracy in making predictions.

This project highlights my ability to work with machine learning techniques, apply them to real-world datasets, and produce results that are both interpretable and essential for decision-makers.
